# ML-Linear-Regression-Study

Machine learning model for linear regression study of a real estate market dataset.

For this case, we had a real estate merket dataset, with informations regarding the house and the neighboring area's houses and residents:

1. Asset price;
2. Average income;
3. Average age;
4. Average number of rooms;
5. Average number of bedrooms; and
6. Estimated population;

For this project he following libraries where used:

1. Pandas: Data manipulation;
2. Seaborn: Comparative data visualization;
3. Plotly: Data visualization;
4. Sklearn: ML training;
5. Matplotlib: Comparative plot of test data vs. predicted data;

Results:
  The trained linear regression model, using a train data size of 70%, achienved a coefficient of determination of ~0.9147.
